# When Agile Meets STC

## What is Agile
Agile is a terminology that stands for many concpets: agile mindset, agile manifesto (which is instituted by 4 values and 12 principles), agile methodologies, agile engineering practices, business agility... you name it. Despite of all these stuff, why agile, what benefit it brings, and why it is so important to adopt agile in the business world nowadays?

Well, the answer to the questions is pretty simple: we are living in a UVCA world in the 21st century. All the volatility uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity determines that we can't solve business challenges standalone, and we can't have a final solution in the first place. We can't guarrantee that we always success, nor shall we keep the customers waiting until the final "ta-da" moment. Therefore, the agile concepts emerge: 
* Welcome change
* Fail fast and fail early
* Build-feedback loops
* Continuous delivery
* Value driven development
* Small slice of value increment
* Learning by exploring
* Continuous improvement

Finally, in the year 2001, the [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](http://agilemanifesto.org/) is published:
> **Individuals and interactions** over *processes and tools*
>
> **Working software** over *comprehensive documentation*
>
> **Customer collaboration** over *contract negotiation*
>
> **Responding to change** over *following a plan*

The manifesto is the guideline for any attempt of changes in terms of surviving and blooming in the VUCA world.
